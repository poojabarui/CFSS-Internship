Exploiting Web Application APIs

Exploiting Web Application APIs [project : test the security of APIs in a web application, looking for common vulnerabilities the insecure authentication, improper input validation, or excessive data exposure; Tools and Software- Burp Suite(for API interception and testing), Postman(for testing API requests and responses), OWASP ZAP(for automated API Scanning)]

Uses:
This project for vulnerabilities such as insecure authentication, improper input validation, and excessive data exposure using tools like Burp Suite, Postman, and OWASP ZAP.

Step 1: Set Up the Lab Environment
Choose a Target Web Application:
Use applications like OWASP Juice Shop or DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), which have vulnerable APIs.

Install Tools:
•	Burp Suite Community/Professional Edition: Download.
•	Postman: Download.
•	OWASP ZAP: Download.

Proxy Configuration:
o	Configure your browser (e.g., Firefox or Chrome) to route traffic through Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP. 
o	Set up the proxy in Postman to test API requests via these tools.


Step 2: Intercept and Explore APIs
Using Burp Suite, Intercept API Requests:
•	Start Burp Suite and set up the proxy. 
•	Navigate to the web application and trigger API requests (e.g., logins, form submissions).
•	Capture the requests in Burp Suite’s Proxy > HTTP history tab.

Analyze API Endpoints:
Look for: 	URLs (e.g., /api/v1/login, /api/v1/data).
HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type).
Request/Response payloads.


Step 3: Test Authentication and Authorization
Insecure Authentication, API Key Exposure:
Check if API keys are visible in the request URL or response headers.

Token Reuse:
Capture a valid token and use it repeatedly to test for expiration or reuse protection.

Weak Password Policy:
Attempt to log in with weak credentials like admin: admin or password:12345.

Broken Authorization:
Modify parameters to access unauthorized resources.
Example: Change GET /api/v1/user/123 to GET /api/v1/user/124.

Step 4: Test Input Validation
Improper Input Validation, SQL Injection:
Use Burp Suite’s Repeater to send a malicious payload:

sql
' OR 1=1 --
Observe if the API returns sensitive data.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Submit JavaScript payloads like:

html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
Check if the response reflects the payload.

Path Traversal:
Attempt to access files outside the intended directory:

bash
../../etc/passwd

Excessive Data Exposure:
Inspect API responses for sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or PII.


Step 5: Automate Scanning
Using OWASP ZAP, Import the API:
•	Open OWASP ZAP and import the API definition (Swagger/OpenAPI file) if available.
•	Navigate to Import > Import OpenAPI Definition.

Active Scan:
•	Select the API endpoints and run an active scan.
•	Analyze the results for vulnerabilities like:

Missing input validation.
•	Authentication flaws.
•	Sensitive data exposure.

Review Alerts: Go to the Alerts tab and prioritize issues for manual validation.


Step 6: Test APIs Using Postman
Import API Collection:
Load the API definition (Swagger/OpenAPI) or manually create requests.

Test with Custom Payloads:
Use Postman to send crafted payloads and check responses:

•	Invalid inputs.
•	Malicious data.


Authentication Testing:
Test API endpoints requiring tokens, cookies, or API keys by manipulating authorization headers.

Automate with Scripts: Use Postman pre-request and test scripts to automate testing logic.


Step 7: Document Findings
Log Vulnerabilities:
Document each vulnerability with details like:
•	Affected endpoint.
•	Vulnerability type.
•	Steps to reproduce.
•	Potential impact.


Step 8: Remediation (Optional)
Secure Authentication: Use strong password policies, token expiration, and multi-factor authentication.
Implement Input Validation: Sanitize inputs and validate data types.
Avoid Data Exposure: Return only necessary data in API responses.
