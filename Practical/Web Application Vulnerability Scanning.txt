Web Application Vulnerability Scanning

Web Application Vulnerability Scanning [Project- scan and test a vulnerable web application (like DVWA or Juice Shop) for more advanced vulnerabilities, such as Broken Authentication, File Upload Vulnerabilities, or Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR); Tools and Software- Burp Suite(for advanced scanning and automated vulnerable detection), OWASP ZAP(for advanced web application scanning), Nikto(for comprehensive web server vulnerability scanning)]

Uses:
 DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App) or OWASP Juice Shop for advanced vulnerabilities such as Broken Authentication,  File Upload Vulnerabilities, and IDOR.

Step 1: Set Up the Environment

Install a Vulnerable Web Application:
•	DVWA: Download from DVWA GitHub and host it on a local web server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
•	OWASP Juice Shop: Download from Juice Shop GitHub or run it via Docker.

Install Tools:
•	Burp Suite Community/Professional Edition: Download.
•	OWASP ZAP: Download.
•	Nikto: Download.

Set Up Proxy:
•	Configure the browser (e.g., Firefox/Chrome) to use Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP as a proxy for intercepting and analyzing traffic.

Prerequisites: Enable necessary permissions in DVWA/Juice Shop to interact with features prone to vulnerabilities.

Step 2: Basic Scanning

Using Nikto:
•	Open a terminal and run Nikto against your vulnerable application:
nikto -h http://<dvwa-or-juice-shop-url>




Review the output to identify potential issues like outdated software, misconfigurations, and known vulnerabilities.

Step 3: Advanced Scanning with OWASP ZAP

Start OWASP ZAP:
Open the application and set up the target URL.Use the "Spider" feature to crawl the application and identify all endpoints.

Active Scan:
Run the active scan to test for vulnerabilities like IDOR, broken authentication, or insecure file uploads.
Analyze Results:
Look for issues flagged in the "Alerts" tab. Prioritize vulnerabilities such as broken authentication and missing access controls.

Step 4: Advanced Testing with Burp Suite
1.	Intercept Requests: Open Burp Suite, configure the proxy, and intercept the traffic from the web application.
2.	Test for Broken Authentication: Go to the login page of the vulnerable application. Use the "Repeater" tool to manipulate login requests (e.g., bypass authentication by changing parameters).
3.	Test for File Upload Vulnerabilities: Identify file upload endpoints in the application.Try uploading files with malicious extensions (e.g., .php) and observe the response.Use the "Intruder" tool to automate payload testing.
4.	Test for IDOR: Look for endpoints that access resources via parameters like ?id=123. Modify the parameter in Burp Suite's "Repeater" to access unauthorized resources.

Step 5: Document Vulnerabilities
Classify Findings:
Categorize vulnerabilities (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).

Record Details:
Document the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, potential impact, and mitigation.

Generate Reports:
Use OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite's reporting features to generate a structured vulnerability report.


Step 6: Remediation (Optional)
Research for securing the identified vulnerabilities. Apply mitigation strategies if you have access to the application's code or configuration.
