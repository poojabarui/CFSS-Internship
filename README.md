# CFSS-Internship
All the theory questions answer of this company's internship, with the practical projects and practical ctf challenges.


# Practical Challenges: (Perform Any 5)
<h3>1. Web Application Vulnerability Scanning</h1>
<pre> Project: Scan and test a vulnerable web application (like DVWA or Juice Shop) for more advanced vulnerabilities, such as broken authentication, file upload vulnerabilities, or insecure direct object references (IDOR).
 Tools and Software:
        o Burp Suite Pro (for advanced scanning and automated vulnerability detection)
        o OWASP ZAP (for advanced web application scanning)
        o Nikto (for comprehensive web server vulnerability scanning)</pre>

<h3>2. Network Enumeration and Exploitation</h3>h3>
<pre> Project: Perform an in-depth network penetration test, focusing on advanced network enumeration, privilege escalation, and exploitation of services.
 Tools and Software:
        o Nmap (for network discovery and port scanning)
        o Netcat (for creating reverse shells and network exploration)
        o Nessus (for vulnerability scanning)
        o Hydra (for brute-force attacks on various protocols like FTP, SSH, etc.)</pre>

<h3>3. Pivoting and Internal Network Exploitation</h3>
<pre> Project: After gaining initial access to a network, use pivoting techniques to exploit other internal systems. This simulates lateral movement within a compromised network.
 Tools and Software:
        o Metasploit (for exploiting vulnerabilities and pivoting)
        o Proxychains (for routing traffic through compromised machines)
        o Responder (for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks)</pre>

<h3>4. Exploiting Web Application APIs</h3>
<pre> Project: Test the security of APIs in a web application, looking for common vulnerabilities like insecure authentication, improper input validation, or excessive data exposure.
 Tools and Software:
         o Burp Suite (for API interception and testing)
         o Postman (for testing API requests and responses)
         o OWASP ZAP (for automated API scanning)</pre>

<h3>5. Vulnerability Analysis of Active Directory</h3>
<pre> Project: Conduct a security audit of Active Directory (AD) environments to discover weaknesses like insecure configurations, weak password policies, or privilege escalation opportunities.
 Tools and Software:
        o BloodHound (for analyzing AD permissions and finding privilege escalation paths)
        o PowerView (for PowerShell-based AD enumeration and exploitation)
        o Mimikatz (for extracting password hashes and Kerberos tickets)</pre>

<h3>6. Bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAF)</h3>
<pre> Project: Attempt to bypass a web application firewall (WAF) by using various evasion techniques to exploit web application vulnerabilities.<br>
 Tools and Software:
      o Burp Suite (for custom WAF evasion techniques)
      o SQLMap (for SQL injection attacks that bypass WAFs)
      o WAFW00F (to identify and bypass WAFs)</pre>

<h3>7. Exploit Development and Reverse Engineering</h3>
<pre> Project: Develop an exploit for a known vulnerability and reverse engineer binary applications to understand how exploits work.
 Tools and Software:
        o Ghidra (for reverse engineering binaries)
        o Immunity Debugger (for debugging and developing exploits)
        o Metasploit Framework (for developing and testing custom exploits)</pre>

# Theory Questions: (Attempt All )
1. What is the difference between white-box, black-box, and gray-box penetration testing?<br>
 Explanation: Describe the key differences in the level of access and knowledge provided to the penetration tester in each approach, and explain when each is used in real-world scenarios.

2. What are the main phases of a penetration test, and what activities are performed in each phase?<br>
 Explanation: List and explain the key phases of a penetration test, including planning, reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, exploitation, post-exploitation, and reporting.

3. Explain the concept of "pivoting" in penetration testing. How is it used to move within a compromised network?<br>
 Explanation: Define pivoting, describe how it is performed in a penetration testing scenario, and explain how a tester can use it to escalate access within a network after compromising a single system.
